//================================
//Difference between commonjs and ES6 JS dialects (syntactic versions of JS!)

//traditional way of declaring a js variable
//var

//More modern way
//let and const --> ES6 (Module dialect)

// .then() ---> was the old/traditional (commonjs) way of declaring async

//This is just to show you that I can use the cowsay package code

// const cowsay = require("cowsay");
// Commonjs dialect

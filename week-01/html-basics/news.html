    <p>Perhaps this is the news which most people fear to read in their suggestions so early in the morning, man sensibly deposits his money into his bank account. However, in the case of Sebastian Gibbs that is exactly what happened. Police say they are currently investigating the incident where a 34 year old man from Leeds is alleged to have done something sensible. "We had an emergency report on friday evening from the perpetrator's wife, with the pseudoname 'Not Mrs Gibbs' that her husband had unfortunately gone ahead and sensibly partitioned some of his months wages into a savings account that the couple both share." PC Inspector Martin Mischiefsearcher commented. "We currently belief that the lady who made this report is not Mr Gibbs wife, and would of disposed of the money like any sane person rather than putting them in a savings account. She is not under suspicion at the current time."</p>

    <p>Another man who wishes to go by the psuedoname of 'Not Sebastian Gibbs son' responded to requests to comment when we reached out. "I don't know how he could do this. He's not me Dad by the way but we always told him to throw money into the bin as soon as it lands in his hands!"</p>

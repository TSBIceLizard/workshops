            Responsive design in web development refers to the adaptability of your website design and layout to a multitude of different screen aspects and resolutions. Desktop monitors are normally wider than they are taller, but things like phone display's have screens that are taller than they are wider.
        </p>

        <p>A website that has good responsive design is basically able to re-adjust itself (in some cases) to fit the size and aspect ratio of any screen and without the layout heinously (or hideously) breaking.

                The @media rule in CSS is one extreme method to enforce responsivity in the occasion that the end user is accessing the website from a different device, such as a tablet or a smartphone. Instead of necessarily identifying that the user is on a smartphone, tablet or desktop directly, this rule will ascertain "what to do" when the user's display is less than X amount of pixels on the width or height vectors. 
            </p>    
            <p>
                This rule will even affect desktop computers if the user changes the browser window shape to something relatively extreme that would mimic the proportions to that of a different device.

# How the internet works Worshop

## Localhost
A localhost refers to the users active system and doesn't pertain to being connected to the internet. Connecting to a website not on a server and just being hosted within your own computer's filesystem - this is via the localhost.

It is a form of loopback - where the computer sends a request to itself.

## Nameservers
A name server is a facet of DNS, a system which converts a domain name - be it www.google.com, www.yahoo.com, www.youtube.com etc and translates that into an IP address which the network system understands better.

It's similar to when using a post service. Knowing what somebody's house looks like on the outside and it's appearance is different to the post code, the latter which the postal service looks up to identify the correct location to administer the post to.

## Client and server relationship
Simply put, a client is a person or user 'accessing' a server (host). In the case of websites, the client is the computer and browser that a specific person is using to access a server. A server is a host which a client (or many clients) connect to over a network. That network can be a local area network or a larger network such as the internet. An example of a server is something that hosts a website, a service, it is network infrastructure that supports end users 'connecting' to it and making use of it based on its purpose.

## What is a port
A port is a component of an IP address, and is the 4 numbers after the : symbol. The port specifies the vector of an application or service which can or is interfacing with a network.
